If you did not already, please refer to the installation guide in setup.md. It will guide you through the necessary steps to run jupyter notebook on your personal machine, using the required python packages.

This repo offers a quick blow through all the beginning steps to use python and sunpy. Most material is inspired by scipy lecture notes (https://scipy-lectures.org/) and sunpy tutorials (https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/generated/gallery/index.html). The tutorial itself will be more of a classical presentation, although it is highly recommended to type along and run a few tests by oneself.
